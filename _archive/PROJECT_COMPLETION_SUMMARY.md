## 🔧 **Core System Components**

### 1. **Data Pipeline Workflows** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Data Collector**: Fetches weather data from OpenWeather API and news from NewsAPI
- **Data Validator**: Validates data quality with configurable rules and scoring
- **Data Processor**: Enriches data with ML features, trends, and calculated fields
- **Data Reporter**: Generates HTML reports and sends Slack notifications

### 2. **Infrastructure Stack** ✅ COMPLETE
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database with complete schema (audit_logs, processed_data, alerts, etc.)
- **Redis**: Caching layer for performance and session management
- **Nginx**: Reverse proxy with SSL termination and rate limiting
- **Grafana**: Real-time dashboards for monitoring and visualization

### 3. **Custom Extensions** ✅ COMPLETE
- **DataTransformer Node**: 5 operations (normalize, aggregate, enrich, clean, extractFeatures)
- **Custom Webhooks**: Automated workflow chaining and API integrations
- **Advanced Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics and Alertmanager notifications

---

## 🚀 **Immediate Deployment Guide**

### Step 1: Import the 4 Final Workflows
```bash
# The workflows are ready in /workflows/final/
# Import these files directly into n8n:
- data-collector.json
- data-validator.json  
- data-processor.json
- data-reporter.json
```

### Step 2: Configure API Keys
```bash
# Add these to your .env file:
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_key
NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=your_slack_webhook
```

### Step 3: Start the System
